🧭 Goal

Build a production-grade Tenant Admin frontend for:

Driver verification

Fleet verification

Vehicle verification

Tenant setup (countries, cities)

that:

Matches previous pages’ theme

Is scalable, maintainable, and consistent

Works cleanly with your existing backend routes

Feels like an internal SaaS admin console (not a demo UI)

1️⃣ Overall Frontend Strategy
Treat Tenant Admin as a sub-application

Not just pages.

One layout

One navigation

One design language

One interaction pattern reused everywhere

This prevents UI drift as features grow.

2️⃣ Authentication & Role Gate (Critical)
Before anything else:

Decode JWT after login

Extract:

user_id

tenant_id

roles

Allow access only if:

role contains TENANT_ADMIN

tenant admin is approved (backend already enforces this)

UX rule:

Unauthorized → redirect to 403 / Access Denied

Never partially render admin pages

3️⃣ Layout & Navigation Rules
Layout structure

Left sidebar (fixed width)

Main content area

No nested layouts inside admin

Sidebar sections

Dashboard (optional summary)

Drivers

Fleets

Vehicles

Tenant Setup

UX rules

Active section must be visually highlighted

Sidebar must not reload between page changes

Keep navigation depth max 2 levels

4️⃣ Visual Design Principles (Production Look)
Color & spacing

Neutral background (light gray / off-white)

White cards on top

One primary color for actions

One danger color for reject actions

Typography

1 font family only

3 sizes max:

Page title

Section title

Body text

Spacing

Consistent padding everywhere

Same card spacing across drivers/fleets/vehicles

👉 If spacing is inconsistent, the page instantly looks “student-built”.

5️⃣ Page Types (Standardize These)

You only need 3 page types for everything.

A️⃣ “Pending List” Pages

(Drivers / Fleets / Vehicles)

Purpose

Show what needs attention

Rules

Table layout

One row = one entity

Columns:

ID / Name

Status (badge)

Created date

Row click navigates to details

UX requirements

Empty state (no pending items)

Loading skeleton

No inline actions (keeps table clean)

B️⃣ “Document Review” Pages

(Core of your system)

Purpose

Verify uploaded documents safely

Structure

Entity summary at top

ID

Tenant

Current approval status

Document list (cards or rows)

Verification controls

Document card must show:

Document type

Uploaded preview / link

Verification status

Verified by (if exists)

Verified on (if exists)

Action rules

Approve / Reject per document

Disable buttons after decision

Confirm modal before action

Backend rule mapping (important)

If any doc is verified by another admin → lock page

Show clear error message

Do not allow partial approvals

C️⃣ “Setup / Management” Pages

(Tenant cities, countries)

Purpose

Configuration, not approvals

UX rules

Forms always in modals or separate pages

Bulk actions require preview step

Show success summary after submit

Bulk add cities

Must clearly show:

Created cities

Already mapped cities

Final mapped count

6️⃣ Status Handling (Consistency Is Key)

Use only these states visually:

PENDING → amber/yellow badge

APPROVED → green badge

REJECTED → red badge

Rules:

Never mix text + color inconsistently

Same status must look identical across all pages

7️⃣ Error Handling & Messaging
Errors you must explicitly handle

403 → Not allowed for this tenant

409 → Another admin already started verification

400 → Missing documents

UX pattern

No raw backend messages

Show friendly message

Keep admin on same page

Example intent:

“Verification already in progress by another tenant admin.”

8️⃣ State Management Guidelines
What should be global state

Logged-in user

Tenant info

Role info

What should be local state

Document lists

Verification loading state

Modals

Rule

If two pages don’t need the same data → don’t globalize it.

9️⃣ API Interaction Rules

One API layer per feature

UI never calls Axios directly

One request = one responsibility

No chained calls inside components

After approve/reject

Optimistically update UI

Then re-fetch entity status if needed

🔐 10️⃣ Security UX Rules

Never expose tenant_id in URL unless backend checks it

Never trust frontend for role checks

Disable buttons instead of hiding them (clear intent)

🧪 11️⃣ Testing & Validation Checklist

Before calling it “production-ready”:

✔ Login as tenant admin
✔ Try cross-tenant access (must fail)
✔ Two admins verify same entity (409 flow)
✔ Reject one doc → entity must stay pending
✔ Approve all docs → entity auto-approved
✔ No pending entities → empty state shown
